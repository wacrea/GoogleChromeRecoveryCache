What is it ?
============

When you search a file (css, html, js etc.) into the cache of Google Chrome, it give you an encrypted code. If you want to restore your file from the cache : this script is for you !

How it works ?
--------------

Copy/paste your encrypted hexa code in "cache.txt" and lunch index.php : your file was re-created in "t.bin" ! :D

I hope it's will help
